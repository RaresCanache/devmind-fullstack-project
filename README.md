# Backend API Documentation

## Overview
This backend API provides user management, expense tracking, bank account handling, financial planning, and transactions management (WIP). It includes specific CRUD endpoints for records related to users, expenses, bank accounts, financial plans, and transactions.
Additionaly, the user controller also handles Spring Security specific endpoints: `/login` and `/register`, which generate and validate a unique Bearer Token.

As mentioned previously, Spring Security helps with implementing the **JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication** approach, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources. It is structured into several components, including configurations for JWT setup, request filtering, and authentication services.

# Savings Logic

## Overview
The **SavingsServiceImpl** is responsible for computing the **daily required savings balance** based on a user's financial plan, expenses, and bank account balance. It ensures that the user stays on track with their financial goals by calculating a structured savings plan.

## How It Works

* The financial plan duration is calculated using **ChronoUnit.DAYS** to determine the total number of days.
* Total expenses are summed using a **reduce function**.
* The daily balance adjustment is computed by subtracting expenses and savings from the starting balance, then distributing the remaining amount evenly with **RoundingMode.HALF_UP**.
* Daily savings requirements are generated by iterating through the period and adjusting amounts for display on the **Front-End** calendar.
